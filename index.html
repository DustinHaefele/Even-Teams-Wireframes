      <h3>About Even Teams</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever had to be a captain for a pick up game of soccer? Or have
        you ever organized a single person sign up tournament? Than you know how
        hard it can be to make teams as even as possible. No one wants to come
        out and play a friendly game of volleyball on a wednesday night and lose
        25-10. That's where we come in. We take the best even split algorithm
        available and put it to work to make your teams as even as
        scientifically possible!
